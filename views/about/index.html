        <p class="lead">My name is Raven Conyers and I am an inspiring Software Developer. All my life I have been surrounded by technology. My grandpa builds computers and helps people when they have comupter problems. Growing up watching him do these things made me interested in the world of technology. I wanted to know how things worked and why they worked as they did. The first thing that I had once decided that I wanted to do when I became interested in technology was to be a website developer. I tried to learn on my own but it became to difficult. I need a teacher to be there for me to truly understand a topic and with everything that I had to do in school it seemed nearly impossible so I gave up on the dream. I had then decided to go into the field of nursing with the intent of being able to help people. However, I was then introduced to NYOT and it sparked an interet that had been dorment in me for a while. I now want to become a software developer and be able to make my own websites.</p>
        <p class="lead"> Being a part of NYOT has helped me to realize what I want to do with my life in the future. I never would of imagined myself actually taking on a career in the tech world until I became a part of New York on Tech. I have learned so much about coding that I never would of learned otherwise. NYOT has opened up so many doors for me and I couldn't be more thrilled to take what I have learned here and apply it elsewhere. I have learned about CSS, HTML, Java Script, and JQuery due to this program. I hae also learned a lot of valuable life skills at NYOT because they are a lot mroe than just coding. I have created a resume here at NYOT and I learned a lot about public speaking, presentations, and a lot more. I will take everything that I have learned here and use it to my benefit. I have been prepared for the reaal world and for college because of NYOT and I couldn't be more greatful.  </p>
